Project Description

Parrot Box is your virtual emotional support pet bird that keeps you humbled, roasting you for that necessary ounce of motivation.

The Problem (that doesnâ€™t exist)

This is an initiative to give voice to the inner monologue of a procrastinator that goes unnoticed and unheard even by the procrastinator.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

The inner monologue of a procrastinator is now a parrot on your screen. The parrot squeaks nonstop about the work you are avoiding. Additionally, your parrot is naturally tarot-trained; it might help pick your cards that are affirmative.
